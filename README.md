# Neural-Style-Transfer

### Dataset and Transfer learning
The pre-trained model should be downloaded from [here](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat) and stored in the folder "pre-trained model".

## Neural Style Transfer
Art Style Transfer consists in the transformation of an image into a similar one that seems to have been painted by an artist.
The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), composed of a series of layers of convolutional matrix operations, are ideal for image analysis and object identification. They employ a similar concept to graphic filters and detectors used in applications like Gimp or Photoshop, but in a much powerful and complex way.
