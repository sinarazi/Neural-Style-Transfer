# Neural-Style-Transfer

### Dataset and Transfer learning
The pre-trained model should be downloaded from [here](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat) and stored in the folder "pre-trained model".

## Neural Style Transfer
Art Style Transfer consists in the transformation of an image into a similar one that seems to have been painted by an artist.
The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), composed of a series of layers of convolutional matrix operations, are ideal for image analysis and object identification. They employ a similar concept to graphic filters and detectors used in applications like Gimp or Photoshop, but in a much powerful and complex way.
To say the least, not only is it fun and joyful but also it gives you prespctive about paintings of great artists, such as Vincent Van Gogh, and it gives you a chance to familiarize yourself with their various kinds of paintings and thier differences.
